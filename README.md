# -How-to-watch-Alexander-Volkanovski-vs-Diego-Lopes-UFC-To-Be-Announced-April-12-2025

Fight Background
Alexander Volkanovski: The ex-featherweight champion is attempting to shake off a rough patch that saw him suffer back-to-back knockout losses to Islam Makhachev and Ilia Topuria in championship matchups. Volkanovski’s 14-month absence to heal and refocus will end, as he will look to regain control of the featherweight division. One of the most technically sound fighters in MMA history, Volkanovski is known for his striking accuracy, distance management and effectiveness against grappling threats.
Diego Lopes: Lopes has quickly climbed the featherweight ladder, landing a title shot after taking out elite level contenders such as Brian Ortega and Dan Ige. A powerful finisher on the feet and with a strong ground game, Lopes excels in chaotic striking exchanges and has also handled rough waters in high-pressure moments. But João, if he has a weakness, could be wrestling and defensive striking against a seasoned fighter like Volkanovski.
Key Factors in the Fight
Volkanovski’s Form: With two knockout losses in the twilight of his career, it remains to be seen if Volkanovski can return to the form that had him in the conversation as one of the best fighters of all time. If he fights like he did against Max Holloway or Yair Rodriguez, his superior striking technique and fight IQ could be a substantial advantage.

The Power and Aggression of Lopes: Lopes holds serious power in his hands and a fair amount of unpredictability. His ability to overwhelm opponents early is a threat to Volkanovski, too, considering the Australian has been knocked out recently.
The Ground Game Dynamic: Lopes does his best work with submissions on top of shots and scrambles, but Volkanovski has, throughout the years, taken that awareness and made it his career, frustrating elite submission grapplers such as Brian Ortega and Islam Makhachev. The issue Lopes will face is the risk of those takedown attempts being left open for counters.
Cardio and Championship Rounds: One of Volkanovski’s trademarks has been his cardio, which has maximized his output in championship rounds. If Lopes is not able to score an early stoppage, fatigue could well play out in Volkanovski’s favor as he takes advantage of any openings.
